# OpenBSD-FAQ-BR

OpenBSD's FAQ Translated to Brazilian Portuguese.

Related OpenBSD's subprojects (and portable softwares) will also have their space here;

	* OpenSMTPd
	* SPAMd
	* OpenNTPd
	* pf
	* LibreSSL
	* OpenBGPd
	* ...

This initiative was mentored and coordinated by Antoine Jacoutot (ajacoutot@) in the past. Every code was CVS powered and hosted by ajacoutot@ himself at steelix.BSDFrog.org till mid-2014.

A russian version of the OpenBSD's FAQ and pages is also available on GitHub thanks to Alexander Naumov (https://github.com/alexander-naumov/openbsd-doc-ru).
